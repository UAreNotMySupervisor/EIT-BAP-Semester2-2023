<br>

### Description:

In this document, different Wordpress plugins will be analyzed how they meet the necessary requirements that were set in the Project Proposal. 

<br>

### Goal:

The goal of this document is to find the best combination of plugins that meet all the requirements and provide the best quality for the client.

<br>

### Procedure:

In the following table, all assembled plugins will be listed. For each plugin, we will assess which requirements each plugin meets and which requirements, they do not fulfill. There is also a pro-and-con section for each plugin to determine significant advantages and disadvantages of the respective plugin.
