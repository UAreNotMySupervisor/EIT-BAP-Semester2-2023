# List of Tasks for the Formal Documentation

## Purpose:

In this document, we list all the different parts of the formal documentation, which need to be completed. We use this list in the future as a checklist/reference to check the status of the assignment. Documenting all the necessary parts beforehand helps us splitting up the workload easier and prevents errors like missing parts during the process of finishing the formal documentation.
