# Conclusion

### Purpose:

This document contains the conclusion of the formal docuementation

<br>

During the documentation phase of this project, we encountered some obstacles, which we needed to understand, document and find solutions to.
This includes decisions like writing our own plugins, how to combine various plugins, what requirements are important for an effective operation of the website, how are we going to test all the documented requirements and so on. In regards to self-written plugins, we decided to create a WordPress website by fully relying on third-party plugins. We concluded that by efficiently combining these plugins, we will have a better overall quality then by creating our own software from scratch .Trough communication with the client, we try to include as many requirements as possible and, therefore, provide the client with a high quality product at the end of this project. By documenting these aspects, we are prepared to begin the next phase of this project: the development of the website. This phase brings together all the acquired documents to form the final product which will be delivered to the client.
