#Meeting Report 2

Date: 17 August 2023
Location: Student Village Villa 12

Participants: Lukas, Talgat, Michael

After meeting with John, we have improved and finalized the project proposal. But before hand, we have split the proposal into 3 parts for each team member to contribute. Where as Talgat did section 1 and documentation, while Lukas has covered section 2 & 4 and Michael completed section 3 & 5. We have also discussed which roles does the project needs for development and split them based on each member's skills and specialization. All 3 of us had to download Uniform Server and WordPress as required by John Jamieson.
