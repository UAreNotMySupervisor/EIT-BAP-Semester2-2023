# Meeting Report 4

Date: 15 September 2023
Location: Student Village

During this team meeting, we dicussed the workflow for the upcoming assignment and how we can complete this assessment most efficiently. We came to the conclusion to first gather all the necessary parts of the assignment, before splitting them up among the team members. During the process of working on the individual parts, we also want to focus on giving quick feedback within the team to achieve the best possible result. This is accomplished by pushing every little detail of each document to the repository so that the other team members can react to it. As for the next steps, we agreed on identifying all the required parts of the assignment and splitting them up at the beginning of next week.
